# Change Log

## v1.4.0

### Added

- A brand-new egui-based GUI, called `rpgmap-gui`. This brings interactivity to
  the rpgtools experience, but it's still in the early stages so functionality
  is limited.

## v1.3.0

### Updated

- Updated all dependencies to their latest version.

### Fixed

- Numerous formatting and clippy issues.


## v1.2.0

### Added

- SVG-based sprite for floors. Right now there's only one; hopefully it looks
  better than a solid colour.
- `--num-rooms` option lets the user control how many rooms should be placed in
  "halls" dungeons.
- `--room-size` option lets the user control the size of the rooms that are
  placed in "halls" dungeons.
- `--scale` option to control the number of pixels in each square.
- `--output` option to control the output file name (only PNG supported for now).
